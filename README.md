Welcome to my CodeWars problem solutions project on GitHub! In this repository, you will find a collection of solutions to various challenges I encountered on CodeWars, an online platform for improving your coding skills by solving coding problems.

## What is CodeWars?

[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an online platform that offers a wide range of programming challenges for developers of all skill levels. The problems are categorized by difficulty and cover various topics such as algorithms, data structures, mathematics, string manipulation, and more. Challenges are presented in popular programming languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, among others.

## Project Objective

The objective of this repository is to share the solutions I have developed while facing the challenges on CodeWars. I aim to provide functional and efficient implementations as examples to help other developers learn and improve their programming skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository has the problems numbered, everytime I resolve a new Kata I just add it to the list. Currently my focus is to solve Kata in my preffered language:

- C#


Inside each file, you will find the problem statement, followed by my solution along with explanatory comments detailing the approach used.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have a more efficient, elegant solution, or one in a language that is not yet covered, feel free to contribute. Simply fork this repository, create a branch with your solution, and then submit a pull request. Please ensure your solutions are properly documented and commented so that others can learn from them.

## Note on Ethics

It is important to remember that CodeWars is an educational platform, and the purpose of this repository is to share knowledge and programming techniques. By contributing to or using the solutions presented here, you agree not to use this knowledge for malicious purposes or to cheat on the platform.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the CodeWars community for providing such an engaging and challenging platform to improve my programming skills. I also appreciate all the contributors who have contributed to this repository and helped improve the solutions presented here.

I hope you find these solutions helpful and that they inspire you to enhance your programming skills. Happy problem-solving and learning!
